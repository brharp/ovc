“I started working at the OVC during the pandemic, and both the wonderful management team and my colleagues have made me feel welcome and supported from day one -- allowing for a smooth transition into my role. As a University of Guelph graduate myself, I’m excited to return to campus, and again, be a part of its buzzing college atmosphere!”
