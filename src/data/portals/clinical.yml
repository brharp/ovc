summary: |
  We want to improve the quality of life for your pet by providing access to
  cutting edge research that would not otherwise be accessible.
  Participation in a clinical trial can also benefit other animals in the
  future. Successful outcomes in veterinary clinical trials can also be of 
  benefit to human medicine.

  subtitle: Follow the step by step process to get involved.
  steps:
    - step: "Step 1"
      title: Look for options 
      content: |
        Once you have a diagnosis of your petâ€™s condition, your search for a clinical trial can begin! Talk to your veterinarian about your interest in companion animal trials and they can help determine suitability for enrolling. 
    - step: "Step 2"
      title: Look for options
      content: |
        Not every clinical trial will be right for you and your pet. Clinical trials have eligibility criteria that determine if your pet is a suitable candidate.  

        Some clinical trials seek companion animals that have specific illnesses or conditions, some trials are limited to a particular species e.g. dog or cat. Eligibility criteria may also include factors such as age, sex, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and any other medical conditions that your pet may have.  
    - step: "Step 3"
      title: Review the study information sheet. 
      content: |
        Clinical trials follow a study protocol which describes the study objectives and plan of action.   The protocol has been approved by the University of Guelph Animal Care Committee and OVC Companion Animal Hospital. Each protocol is designed with the health of your pet in mind whilst ensuring that researchers are able to obtain important study information. Review the protocol information provided by the OVC Clinical trials team. Questions to the team/veterinarian are encouraged! 
    - step: "Step 4"
      title: Contact the study organizers. 
      content: |
         If you think your pet may be a suitable candidate for a particular study at the Ontario Veterinary College or you wish to obtain more information regarding a study(s) please contact Dr. Vicky Sabine (Clinical Trials Coordinator) at ovc.clinicaltrials@uoguelph.ca or the contact name listed on the study page
    - step: "Step 5"
      title: Get enrolled!
      content: |
        Veterinary clinical trials are voluntary, your pet cannot be enrolled into a trial without your knowledge or permission.  The enrollment process with the OVC Clinical Trials team, will provide the information for you to understand the study and your responsibilities.  In addition to the consent document and study information sheet, the process may involve recruitment materials, verbal instructions and further questions regarding your pet.    

        You must sign the client consent document to enroll your pet in a trial and a copy of the signed consent form will be provided for your records. Owners may withdraw their pet from a study at any time, even if study participation has not finished. The clinical care of your pet is not compromised regardless of study participation status although financial incentives often require completion of the study protocol.
