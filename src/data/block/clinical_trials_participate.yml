  We want to provide the highest standard of care for your pet. Veterinary
  clinical trials are specifically designed to benefit your pet while
  advancing scientific knowledge. They allow us to discover new and
  improved ways to prevent disease, diagnose or treat existing patients
  and future patients in all specialties of veterinary medicine by
  thorough evaluation of new medical devices, diagnostic tests, surgical
  procedures and treatments.
