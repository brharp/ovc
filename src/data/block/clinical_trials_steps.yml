        Once you have a diagnosis of your pet's condition, your search
        for a clinical trial can begin! Talk to your veterinarian about your interest in companion animal
        trials and they can help determine suitability for enrolling.
        A full list of our current clinical trials can be found

        Not every clinical trial will be right for you and your
        pet. Clinical trials have eligibility criteria that determine if
        your pet is a suitable candidate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some clinical trials seek companion animals that have
        specific illnesses or conditions, some trials are limited
        to a particular species e.g. dog or cat. Eligibility
        criteria may also include factors such as age, sex, the
        type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history,
        and any other medical conditions that your pet may have.
        Information about these requirements can be found <a href="

        Clinical trials follow a study protocol which describes the
        study objectives and plan of action.   The protocol has been
        approved by the University of Guelph Animal Care Committee and
        OVC Companion Animal Hospital. Each protocol is designed with the
        health of your pet in mind whilst ensuring that researchers are
        able to obtain important study information. Review the protocol
        information provided by the OVC Clinical trials team. Questions
        to the team/veterinarian are encouraged!

    subtitle: Get enrolled!
    body: |
      <p>
        Veterinary clinical trials are voluntary, your pet cannot be
        enrolled into a trial without your knowledge or permission.
        The enrollment process with the OVC Clinical Trials team, will
        provide the information for you to understand the study and your
        responsibilities.  In addition to the consent document and study
        information sheet, the process may involve recruitment materials,
        verbal instructions and further questions regarding your pet.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must sign the client consent document to enroll your pet in
        a trial and a copy of the signed consent form will be provided
        for your records. Owners may withdraw their pet from a study
        at any time, even if study participation has not finished. The
        clinical care of your pet is not compromised regardless of study
        participation status although financial incentives often require
        completion of the study protocol.
